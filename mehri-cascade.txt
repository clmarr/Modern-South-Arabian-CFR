$Proto-West-Semitic to Mehri cascade, for problem set 4 in NELC 5111 (originally)

$final -m effaced. Shared with NW-Sem? 
m > ∅ / __ #

$ʔ effaced. Shared with other branches? 
ʔ > ∅ 

$p > f as in Ethiosemitic and Arabic. Possibility of making an exception word finally (kasapa > kəsoːb, salapa > səloːb) that goes instead to b, but judging by the presence of -s- in both cases aggregated thus far, these might be loan words -- but from where? (Old South Arabian??)
p > f 

$stress seems to be imposed on the penultimate. 
[+syl] > [+prim] / __ ([-syl])* [+syl] ([-syl])* #

$hardcode to remove stress from mina -- a function word
ˈi > i / m __ n [+lo]

$secondary diphthong formation: sometime before apocope, final consonants, or high ones at least, form diphthongs within stressed syllables
	$ yibakkī > Mehri yəbayk
$doesn't affect syllables that already have a glide? baytum > abayt
		$ or is this why we get the a? 

$ stressed short vowels are lengthened
$ doesn't happen to diphthongs, i.e. nucleus plus glide
$ it appears this even happens in closed syllables (yimallik > Mehr. yəmūlək) 
$ but it doesn't occur for yibakkī (M yəbayk, J yōk) -- could be because this became a diphthong, or because it is blocked by voiceless stops(?)
$ going with the former for now as it does not require making another rule, and does make predictions about relative chronology.  

$TODO that! 

$ Unstressed vowels reduced to schwa 
[+syl,-stres] > ə 

$final schwa effaced 
ə > ∅ / __ #

$ Proto-MSA *α, treated as a̯ here, becomes a. Must be after unstressed vowel reductions (and vowel reorientations?) resolve.
a̯ > a 

=Proto-Mehri-Jibbali
$ end of shared developments between Mehri and Jibbali 

$ ʕ changes any following vowel to aː, then disappears
[+syl] > [-hi,-round,+lo,+tense,+long] / ʕ __ 
ʕ > ∅


$at end: delete stress, which is not marked in the output values
[+syl] > [-stres]
