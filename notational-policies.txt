$ this file will have to involve the interpolation of Proto-West-Semitic source forms on the basis of the available comparanda, preferably not involving Mehri (to avoid circularity)

Jibbali/Shehri 

per Rubin 2014, boht s̃ and š in Mehri are treated as palatoalveolar. Although the actual description of the difference for those speakers that make it (cf. Rubin 2014ː 26) is not captured in this way, the policy currently is to treat š as a simple palatoalveolar fricative [ʃ] and [ʃʷ] 

per Rubin 2014 (ː26) , k g and k̩ are velar while x and g̍ are uvular (χ, ʁ)
